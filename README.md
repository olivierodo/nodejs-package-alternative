The Javascript ecosystem got hudge! Nowadays you can find a package for everything....

### Background 

As an open source maintainer i have to consider many aspect when i'm introducing a feature to any of my projects:
* Keeping the project light
* security
* Long term maintenance

This is why every time I'm looking for a new package, I'm asking me, should I really import it ?
Then with the time I started to have a fun time to find alternative to my needs...

Here you are! This will be the place where I will share my alternatives.
